# ARCHITECTURE.md

## Purpose
High-level description of the system’s shape, boundaries, and responsibilities.

This document explains **how to think about the system**, not line-by-line behavior.

---

## System overview
<One or two paragraphs describing what this system is and what it is not.>

---

## Major components
Describe the main subsystems and their responsibilities.

Example:
- Backend services
- Frontend/UI
- Data/storage
- External integrations

---

## Boundaries and responsibilities
- Each component owns its domain.
- Cross-boundary logic should be explicit and minimal.
- Avoid “god modules” that accumulate unrelated behavior.

---

## Data flow (conceptual)
Describe how data moves through the system at a high level.

---

## Invariants
List non-negotiable truths the system must maintain.

Examples:
- Data consistency rules
- Safety or security constraints
- Operational guarantees

---

## What this document is not
- Not a detailed design spec
- Not an implementation checklist
- Not a substitute for tests
