# Skills Index

This repository uses skills to reduce assumption creep and governance drift.

## Skill precedence
1. Repo-level skills override global skills when names match.
2. Otherwise, global skills apply.

## Core skills
- ask-questions-if-underspecified
- intake-interview
- spec-sculptor
- create-plan
- decision-capture
- governance-sync
- bootstrap-repo
- personalize-repo

## Operating rule
If a skill clearly applies, prefer invoking it over re-explaining the workflow.
