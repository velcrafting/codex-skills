## Common workflows
- **Planning:** invoke `$create-plan` when asking for sequencing or implementation approach.
- **Clarification:** invoke `$ask-questions-if-underspecified` when requirements are unclear.
- **Specification:** invoke `$spec-sculptor` to turn ideas into a concrete spec.
- **Decisions:** invoke `$decision-capture` for non-trivial tradeoffs.
- **Governance:** invoke `$governance-sync` after multi-file or structural changes.

## Safety and discipline
- **Secrets:** never commit secrets. Use `.env` files or a secret manager.
- **Scope control:** avoid drive-by refactors unless explicitly requested.
- **Risk:** default to risk-off behavior when uncertainty is high.
