# Kalshi Markets

Standalone, self-contained scripts for Kalshi prediction markets.
Each script is independently executable with zero dependencies between scripts.

## Instructions

- **Default to `--json` flag** for all commands when processing data
- Prioritize high volume markets, series, and events.
- **IMPORTANT**: **Don't read scripts unless absolutely needed** - instead, use `<script.py> --help` to understand options and then call the script with `uv run <script.py> <options>` to get the data you need.
- All scripts work from any directory (use absolute paths internally)

## Progressive Disclosure

Each script contains ~200-300 lines with complete functionality.
Only load the script you need - no unnecessary context.
